# MachineLeariningProject
Machine Learning Project CDV - shared repository

The data consists of 2 splits train_data.csv and test_data.csv. There are numeric observations labelled either -1 or +1. Labels for the training data are located in in train_labels.csv. 
The aim of the project is to predict labels for the testing data.

Desired output:
Save predictions in test_labels.csv,
Prepare a report (saved as report.md)with the explanations on how you came up with the solution. What obstacles you faced and how did you solve them. Add also information about data quality and so on.
